                <p class="lead">John von Neumann was polymath who worked in diverse areas such as mathematics, physics, and computer science.  He was a key member of the Manhattan Project through which he was introduced to computing machines.  von Neumannâ€™s enthusiasm for computers led him to develop a model for computing that still articulates the basic components of ALL modern computers. Named after him, the von Neumann architecture specifies that a computer should have an arithmetic logic unit, a control unit, memory and input/output devices.
